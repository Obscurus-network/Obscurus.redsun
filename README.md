We do a little bit of trolling :troll: 

Only thing that this program does is that it downloads a sound file & background file and sets the background file as background and plays the sound file.
There is also an option for it to make a .md file with custom content. 
Also it drops all of these files into %appdata%
Config explained:

                  dir_name = 'Redsun' #directory name in appdata
                  
                  drop_file = True #should write the .md file

                  file_name = 'README' #filename for the .md file. Can ignore if you set 'drop_file' to 'False'
                  
                  file_content = """only in Ohio bruh""" #file content of the .md file. Can ignore if you set 'drop_file' to 'False'

                  back_url = 'https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1062049894631755997/1083054264252911678/redsun_incident_back.jpg'  #upload your .jpg file to discord and put the download url to here
